# Helping medical professionals in Ethiopia treat newborn babies

##### E-Learning platform enables neonatologists at the LMU Klinikum in Munich to help medical professionals in Ethiopia treating newborn babies and ultimately save lives

MUNICH – 25.06.2021

A new E-Learning platform developed by students at the Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences was announced today by the LMU Klinikum Munich which is initially going to help neonatologists in Munich with teaching medical professionals at the Jimma University Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia how to treat newborn babies and ultimately save their lives as part of the “JimmaNeo” project. Later on, it will enable the medical professionals In Jimma to create their own teaching materials and upload it to the platform. Currently, Ethiopia has zero trained neonatologists and an infant mortality rate of almost 6%, compared to just 0.3% in Germany.

A doctor at the LMU Klinikum who is involved in the project describes it like this: “Since the Covid pandemic keeps us from visiting our Ethiopian friends in person for our trainings in neonatology, this platform helps us to give our friends access to first-class teaching possibilities nonetheless. I especially like how the platform motivates them with those 'quiz battles’ and those funny little unlockable profile pictures.” 

Apart from sharing the aforementioned educational videos, the platform also allows teachers to share additional educational documents as PDF files and to share appointments for live Zoom-Workshops. The users on the other hand will also be able to utilize the platform to take interactive online quizzes to verify their learning progress, which can then be compared to other learners in a “quiz battle”. To further boost their learning motivation, the platform utilizes various gamification elements like unlockable levels and unlockables for avatars.

“I love studying with the platform”, one of the doctors in Jimma said after having tried the latest beta version, “apart from the fact that we’re learning how to save lives which is obviously fantastic it’s also fun and easy to work with. I like how cool my avatar looks after equipping it with the items I got for completing the courses.”

The platform is completely web-based, meaning that it is not required to install any applications to use it, instead it works on every device that has an internet browser, which is important due to the very limited IT infrastructure at the hospital in Jimma. Users can download videos, documents and appointments so that they are able to view them offline. Ultimately, the aim of the project is to be able to conduct a well-prepared local training workshop in Ethiopia sometime in 2022, when international travel restrictions will hopefully have been lifted again.
